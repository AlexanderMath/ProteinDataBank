# protein-data-bank
Code for downloading, preprocessing and visualizing structural proteins from world wide protein data bank.
Take the plot with a grain of salt, I ran the scraper back in 2018 and there was some connection issues so it didn't collect all the data (it might be fair to assume it got a uniform random subset though).
